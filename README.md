## 🔬 Personal Cancer Diagnosis Project

A machine learning project for classifying genetic variants in cancer diagnosis using text analysis and multiple encoding techniques.

### Features

- **Multi-feature Encoding**: Implements various encoding strategies for genetic data
  - One-hot encoding for genes
  - Response coding for variations
  - TF-IDF vectorization for text data
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Custom NLP preprocessing pipeline for medical text
- **Model Comparison**: Tests multiple ML algorithms (SGD, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- **Feature Fusion**: Combines genetic, variation, and text features using sparse matrices
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrices and performance plots

### Dataset

The project uses cancer genetic mutation data with:
- **Training Variants**: Gene, Variation, Class information
- **Training Text**: Medical literature text associated with mutations
- **9 Classes**: Different types of genetic variations

### Key Components

#### 1. Data Preprocessing (`data-preprocess.ipynb`)
- Loads and merges variant and text data
- Implements custom NLP preprocessing
- Handles missing values and data cleaning
- Stratified train/validation/test splits

#### 2. Feature Encoding (`encode.py`)
```python
class Encoder:
    def get_onehotCoding()      # One-hot encoding for categorical features
    def get_response_coding()   # Response-based encoding using class probabilities
```

#### 3. Model Training (`train_model.py`)
```python
def best_parameter()    # Grid search for hyperparameter optimization
def predict_model()     # Model prediction with probability/class output
def visualize_model()   # Training curves and validation visualization
```

#### 4. Visualization (`visual.py`)
- Confusion matrix plots
- Performance metrics visualization
- Class distribution analysis

### Performance

The project achieves competitive performance using:
- **SGDClassifier** with optimized hyperparameters
- **Feature combination** of TF-IDF text vectors, response-coded variations, and one-hot genes
- **Cross-validation** for robust model evaluation

### Models Tested
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
